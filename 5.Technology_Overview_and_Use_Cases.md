#5. Technology overview and Use Cases

##5.I. Overview

The Master Protocol is a meta-layer using bitcoin protocol for a variety of purposes.  The prime uses are the creation and transfer of of meta-layer currencies that leverage Bitcoin's transaction security, shared ledger and public-private key address model.

###5.I.A. Address Types

####5.I.A.1. Unlimited

####5.I.A.2. Limited


###5.I.B. Specification for Issuance

Currently the Master Protocol Specification has two types of token creation methods:

####5.I.B.1. Fixed number of Tokens

####5.I.B.2. Crowd Sale: Variable number of Tokens

https://github.com/mastercoin-MSC/spec#new-property-creation-with-fixed-number-of-tokens

parameters unique to this type are:

Currency identifier desired = 1 for Mastercoin (cannot be bitcoin)
Number Properties per unit invested = 100 indivisible shares
Deadline = January 1st, 2215 00:00:00 GMT
Early bird bonus %/week = 10
Shares for issuer = 1000 indivisible shares


###5.I.C. Token Transfers and Trade Use Cases

Regarding transfer and trade this can be accomplished by a few methods and depends on the particular use case in terms of transfer of property or rights.  For the purpose of this document "Party" is defined as a Bitcoin Address, and these rules apply to meta-layer tokens, not bitcoins.

The are classified using the following structure:

####5.I.C.1. Two Party Transfers

#####5.I.C.1.i. One to One Transfers

The simplest use cases are the transfer of a meta-layer currnencies between two Bitcoin addresses.

######5.I.C.1.i.a. Simple Send

Sending some amount of a meta-layer coin from one party to another.

######5.I.C.1.i.b. Restricted Send 

Sending a meta-layer coin from a Bitcoin address marked as rate-limited or savings.

####5.I.C.2. Transfers Involving More Than Two Parties

#####5.I.C.2.ii One to Many Transfers

Similar to a one-way transfer however, however involving multiple parties as output.  Note that this could either be done at the Bitcoin protocol level or at the Master Protocol level depending on the particular use case.  

######5.I.C.2.iii Many to One Transfers

Calling back a virtual currency. Note that this can only be accomplished at the Master Protocol level and should only be available to virtual currency issue which specifically enable this parameter so that there is explicit consent.

######5.I.C.2.iii.a Special Case: Redemption Payment

When calling back a virtual currency, if a final redemption payment is required.  Again only Master Protocol level and needs to be explicit at time of virtual currency issuance, so that there is explicit consent.

####5.I.C.3. Peer to Peer Trades

#####5.I.C.3.i. Meta-Layer Trades

In this case this typically should involve two parties who do not want to trust each other for trading one virtual currency for another.  The enforcement of the trade is written into the protocol, therefor when Bob offers X-Coin and Alice offers Y-Coin, and their orders match, the transfer is recognized by all other participants.

#######5.I.C.3.i.a. Special Case: Crowd Sale Issuances

Issuances are special types of meta-layer trades, which are involved in the creation of new virtual currencies.

#####5.I.C.3.ii. Bitcoin to Meta-Layer Trades

In this use case the two parties agree on a price, and the meta-layer protocol is able to create a timed contract. But since one of the virtual currencies involved is bitcoin, the meta-layer protocol is not able to enforce the transfer of virtual currencies until the party possessing bitcoins transfers them to the other party within the scope of the agreement

###5.I.E. Smart Property Use Cases


####5.I.E.1. Synthetic Assets

####5.I.E.2. Virtual Property Tokens

####5.I.E.3. Asset Backed Tokens

Tokens which are backed by some sort of asset whether commodity, currency, fund or real property.

May need to collect customer data.

May need to build in fee collection capability into the protocol.

####5.I.E.4. Debt

Needs review of regulations

####5.I.E.5. Shares

Needs review of regulations

####5.I.E.6. Smart Properties

Reguires physical integration and control of physical apparatus.

###5.I.F. Identity Systems

###5.I.G. Data Streams

###5.I.H. Conditionals

####5.I.H.1. Taking Positions

####5.I.H.2. Capabilities Coupling
